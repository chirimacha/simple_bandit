The code folder contains 5 programs. The program "runGlobalVsBanditSimulations.R" incorporates the other 4 codes
1) helperFunctions.R: helper functions that are not specific to a bandit or search 
2) bandit.R: Bandit functions
3) highLevelSearchAlgos.R: General search algorithms and bandit wrapper for search algorithms
4) FunctionsForSimulatedSearch.R: Functions used to simulate searches and compare bandit against benchmark search algorithms
5)runGlobalVsBanditSimulations.R: Prototype for setting up and running experiments
