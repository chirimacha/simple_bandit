The code folder contains 5 programs. The program "runGlobalVsBanditSimulations.R" incorporates the other 4 codes
-helperFunctions.R: helper functions that are not specific to a bandit or search 
-bandit.R: Bandit functions
-highLevelSearchAlgos.R: General search algorithms and bandit wrapper for search algorithms
-FunctionsForSimulatedSearch.R: Functions used to simulate searches and compare bandit against benchmark search algorithms
-runGlobalVsBanditSimulations.R: Prototype for setting up and running experiments
